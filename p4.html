It is a set of commands, written according to rules defined by the programming language, and then these commands go through several stages until they are executed on the computer.The programming language is basically a method that makes it easy for the programmer to write his program in the form of instructions and commands that the computer understands in order to carry out the required work. It is known that the computer converts the scripted language into a series of 0 and 1, on the basis of which it begins its work. To write commands, the chosen programming language provides a set of basic matters to draw upon during the program's creation process and a set of rules that enable you to manipulate and organize information for the purpose of performing the required work.

These principles and rules are generally:

*Information and storage
*Orders and organizing their conduct
*Special design
